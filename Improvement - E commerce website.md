Current:

When accessing the website, the cookie settings pop-up displays all cookie options enabled by default after clicking the “Saznaj više” (Learn More) button. If a user wants to allow only the necessary cookies (neophodni), they must manually disable each of the other five cookie categories one by one using individual toggles, and click on ‘Slažem se’ (I agree).

Request:

Add a new toggle labeled “Samo neophodni” (Only necessary) that, when enabled, automatically disables all non-essential cookie categories with a single click—leaving only the necessary cookies active.

* The toggle should appear in the cookie settings pop-up after clicking on ‘Saznaj vise’, The new 'Samo neophodni' toggle can be positioned **after the 'Personalizacija' toggle**, as a continuation of the existing list.  
* When turned on, the toggle should be green; when off, it should be gray.  
* The default state of the “Samo neophodni” toggle should be off.

Reason:

To streamline the user experience for users who prefer to accept only the essential cookies, allowing them to make this choice quickly and efficiently without manually adjusting each individual setting.
